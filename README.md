# QuickVersesQuery
The purpose of this project is to create a Chinese Reftagger: which can turn Chinese Bible reference in web pages into hover-preview.

This project is inspired by Reftagger: https://reftagger.com/. As a Chinese Christian, I would like to have something similiar in Chinese. Such that I can query the bible verses quickly, especially when viewing creeds, which are full of references.

This project is in initial phase. The regular expression for searching Traditional Chinese Bible references is completed. Also, the search results can be passed to query the verses by JSON API in https://bible.fhl.net.
